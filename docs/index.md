## Schema

### Optional

- `cachefile` (String) Location to cache the `ip-ranges.json` file. If no value is provided, the provider will attempt to cache the ranges file in a default location (`.aws/ip-ranges.json` inside the current user's home directory) and read from it on subsequent runs.
- `expiration` (String) Duration after which the cached `ip-ranges.json` file should be replaced.
